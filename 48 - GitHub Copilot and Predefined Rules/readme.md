# **GitHub Copilot with Predefined Coding Standards in VS Code**

## **Introduction**

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write code faster and more efficiently. With the introduction of an experimental feature in VS Code, developers can now use GitHub Copilot to generate code while adhering to predefined coding standards. This guide will walk you through how to set up and use this feature with clear, detailed examples.

---

## **Prerequisites**

* Installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* GitHub Copilot extension installed and activated
* GitHub Copilot Chat (Experimental) enabled in VS Code
* Basic understanding of coding standards (naming conventions, style guidelines)

---

## **Step 1: Understanding User and Workspace Settings**

VS Code offers two types of settings:

1. **User Settings:** Applied globally to your VS Code installation, affecting all projects.
2. **Workspace Settings:** Applied only to a specific project or repository, ensuring consistent coding standards across the team.

* If you want the coding standards to apply only to a specific project, use Workspace Settings.
* If you want the coding standards to apply to all your projects, use User Settings.

## **Step 2: Setting Up Coding Standards in VS Code**

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the settings menu using one of the following methods:

   * Click on the gear icon in the lower left corner -> Select '**Settings**'.
   * Use the shortcut: `Ctrl + ,` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ,` (Mac).
3. In the search bar, type "**GitHub Copilot Chat**".
4. Locate the `GitHub Copilot Chat: Experimental Code Generation Instructions` setting.
5. Ensure it is enabled.

## **Step 3: Defining Coding Standards in JSON Format**

You can define your coding standards in JSON format directly within the VS Code settings file.

### **Example Coding Standard for Python and TypeScript:**

```json
{
    "github.copilotChat.experimental.codeGeneration.instructions": [
        {
            "text": "In Python, use snake_case for variable names."
        },
        {
            "text": "In TypeScript, use camelCase for function names."
        }
    ]
}
```

* For **Python**: Variables should follow `snake_case`.
* For **TypeScript**: Function names should follow `camelCase`.

## **Step 4: Applying Coding Standards in Your Project**

1. Go to your project folder in VS Code.
2. Create or open a `.vscode/settings.json` file.
3. Copy and paste your coding standards JSON configuration.
4. Save the file.

### **Example for Workspace Settings:**

```json
{
    "github.copilotChat.experimental.codeGeneration.instructions": [
        {
            "text": "Use camelCase for function names in TypeScript."
        },
        {
            "text": "Use snake_case for variable names in Python."
        }
    ]
}
```

## **Step 5: Using GitHub Copilot with Defined Coding Standards**

* Go to any Python or TypeScript file in your project.
* Open GitHub Copilot Chat (`Ctrl + Shift + P` -> "**GitHub Copilot Chat**")
* Provide a prompt for Copilot to generate code.

### **Example Prompt:**

* **Prompt for Python:** "Generate a function to check if a number is even."
* **Expected Output (Python):**

```python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0
```

* **Prompt for TypeScript:** "Generate a function to check if a number is even."
* **Expected Output (TypeScript):**

```typescript
function isEven(number: number): boolean {
    return number % 2 === 0;
}
```

## **Step 6: Managing Complex Coding Standards**

If you have multiple coding standards, you can define them as an array of instructions in your JSON settings.

### **Example:**

```json
{
    "github.copilotChat.experimental.codeGeneration.instructions": [
        {
            "text": "In Python, use snake_case for variable names and always include type hints."
        },
        {
            "text": "In TypeScript, use camelCase for functions, and private fields should start with an underscore (_)."
        }
    ]
}
```

## **Conclusion**

Using GitHub Copilot with predefined coding standards in VS Code helps you maintain consistency in your codebase, making code reviews easier and improving code quality across your projects. By following this guide, you can ensure that all code generated by GitHub Copilot adheres to your specific coding standards, whether for personal use or across your team.
