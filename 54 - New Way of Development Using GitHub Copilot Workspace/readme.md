## **Detailed Step-by-Step Guide with Examples**

### **Step 1: Describe Your Requirement**

1. Navigate to your project repository.
2. Click "Copilot Workspace" and start a new workspace.
3. Enter your requirement in natural language. Example:

   * "Add a new component for uploading new pet details to my Pet Shop application."

### **Example Prompt:**

"Add a new Angular component called 'UploadPet' that allows users to enter pet details, including name, category, image URL, and description."

### **Step 2: Review the Initial Analysis**

1. Copilot Workspace will analyze your project and identify existing components.
2. It will list the components that already exist (like header, footer, etc.).
3. It will suggest a proposed solution. Example:

   * "A new component called `UploadPetComponent` should be created."

### **Step 3: Modify the Specification**

1. Review the generated specifications.
2. Add any additional requirements. Example:

   * "Update README file with the new feature."
   * "Add custom styles for the new component."

### **Step 4: Generate the Code Plan**

1. Click "Generate Plan."
2. GitHub Copilot Workspace will create a detailed plan, file by file.
3. Review the plan. Example:

   * Add `UploadPetComponent` with form fields: name, category, image URL, description.
   * Update `AppModule` to include this new component.
   * Create a service `UploadPetService` to handle the API requests.

### **Copilot Suggestion Example:**

"Would you like to add form validation for pet details?"

### **Step 5: Generate the Code**

1. Click "Implement Selected Files."
2. Copilot will generate the required files:

   * HTML file with a form.
   * TS file with form logic and API calls.
   * CSS file for custom styles.
3. Review the generated code and make any adjustments if needed.

### **Copilot Suggestion Example:**

"Would you like to add a success message after uploading the pet details?"

### **Step 6: Create a Pull Request**

1. Review all the generated files and the changes.
2. Choose to create a new branch or push directly to the main branch.
3. Provide a description for the pull request.
4. Review the PR and merge it once tested.
