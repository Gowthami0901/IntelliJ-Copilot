## **1. Identifying Why a GitHub Action Failed**

1. Go to the GitHub Actions tab of your repository.
2. Select the failed workflow run.
3. Click on the failed job to view the logs.
4. Start GitHub Copilot by clicking the Copilot icon.
5. Use the prompt:

   ```
   Tell me why this job failed.
   ```
6. Copilot will analyze the job logs and provide a detailed explanation of the error.

### **Example:**

If you encounter an error like:

```
Error: Welcome label control is not defined or not accessible in Login.aspx
```

Copilot will explain that the welcome label is missing in your login file.

## **2. Getting Fix Suggestions with Copilot**

1. After understanding the error, ask Copilot for a fix suggestion:

   ```
   Suggest a fix for this error.
   ```
2. Copilot will provide actionable steps to fix the problem.

### **Example:**

If the error is a missing control, it might suggest adding the missing control in your code file.

## **3. Analyzing Job Logs for Passed and Failed Steps**

1. If a job contains multiple steps, ask Copilot to list the successful ones:

   ```
   List the steps that succeeded.
   ```
2. Copilot will display a list of steps that passed before the failure occurred.

## **4. Checking for Related Issues or Discussions**

1. Before creating a new issue, ask Copilot if any related issues exist:

   ```
   Check if there are any related issues or discussions for this error.
   ```
2. If related issues exist, Copilot will list them with links.

## **5. Creating a Detailed GitHub Issue using Copilot**

1. If no related issues exist, ask Copilot to create an issue for you:

   ```
   Capture the error message from the job log and add a fix suggestion. Also, add a reference to this workflow run.
   ```

2. Copilot will draft a complete GitHub issue with:

   * Title
   * Description (including the error log)
   * Suggested fix
   * A reference link to the workflow run

3. Review and copy the issue details to your GitHub Issues tab to create a new issue.

## **Conclusion**

Using GitHub Copilot with GitHub Actions makes it easier to understand why a job failed, quickly fix issues, and efficiently create well-documented GitHub issues. This streamlined approach saves time and reduces debugging efforts for developers.
