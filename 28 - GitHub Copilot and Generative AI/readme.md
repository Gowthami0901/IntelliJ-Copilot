## **3. How GitHub Copilot Works**

* **Contextual Code Suggestions:**

  * Copilot analyzes your code context and provides inline suggestions.
  * Supports multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, etc.).

* **Multi-Line Completions:**

  * Offers complete function implementations based on the code comments or function signatures.

* **Comment-Based Commands:**

  * Developers can use comments to describe the desired functionality, and Copilot will generate the code.
