### **Step-by-Step Guide: GitHub Copilot + Playwright MCP for UI Test Automation**


## **Introduction: What is Playwright?**

**Playwright** is an open-source end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft. It is designed for automating modern web applications across multiple browsers, including:

* **Chromium (Google Chrome)**
* **Firefox**
* **WebKit (Safari)**

### **Key Features of Playwright:**

* **Cross-Browser Support:** Test on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.
* **Multiple Device Emulation:** Simulate mobile and desktop devices.
* **Headless Testing:** Run tests without a GUI for faster performance.
* **Network Interception:** Mock network responses, modify requests, and monitor network activity.
* **Advanced UI Testing:** Supports Shadow DOM, Iframes, and complex CSS selectors.

### **Why Use Playwright with GitHub Copilot?**

Combining **Playwright with GitHub Copilot** (MCP - Multi-Client Proxy) enhances automation by leveraging AI to generate, debug, and optimize test scripts. This setup offers:

* **Fast Test Script Generation:** Copilot can automatically generate test scenarios.
* **Accurate Testing:** Copilot helps identify and fix issues in test scripts.
* **Simplified Debugging:** Direct assistance from Copilot for any test errors.

## **1. Prerequisites**

* **VS Code Installed**: Make sure you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your system.
* **Node.js Installed**: Ensure that Node.js (LTS version) is installed.
* **GitHub Copilot Enabled**: You must have access to GitHub Copilot and its agent mode.
* **GitHub Account**: Logged in with your GitHub account in VS Code.
* **Basic Understanding of Playwright**: Familiarity with Playwrightâ€™s basic concepts.

---

## **2. Install Node.js and NPM**

* Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
* Verify the installation:

  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

## **3. Setup VS Code with GitHub Copilot**

* Open VS Code.
* Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and install **GitHub Copilot**.
* Ensure you are signed in with your GitHub account.
* Go to settings and enable **Copilot Agent Mode**.

---

## **4. Initialize a Playwright Project**

* Open a new folder in IntelliJ (for example: `MCP_Test_Automation`).
* Open the terminal (\`Ctrl+\`\`) and run:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  npm install @playwright/test --save-dev
  npx playwright install
  ```
  ![alt text](../images/img58.png)

* This will set up a basic Playwright project with browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

---

## **5. Setup Playwright MCP (Multi-Client Proxy)**

* Create an `mcp.json` file in your project directory with the following configuration:

  ```json
  {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx playwright",
      "mode": "vision",
      "version": "latest"
    }
  }
  ```
* This configuration ensures that the latest version of Playwright MCP is used.

---

## **6. Launch MCP Server**

* Start the MCP Server by running:

  ```bash
  npx playwright
  ```
* Ensure that the MCP Server is running.

## **7. Create a Sample Web Application for Testing**

* For this guide, we will use a simple login page.
* Create an HTML file (`login.html`) with the following content:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>Login Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <form id="loginForm">
          <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Username" required>
          <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" required>
          <button type="submit">Login</button>
      </form>
      <p id="message"></p>
  </body>
  <script>
      document.getElementById("loginForm").onsubmit = function(event) {
          event.preventDefault();
          const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
          const password = document.getElementById("password").value;

          if (username === "techril" && password === "password123") {
              document.getElementById("message").innerText = "Login Successful";
          } else {
              document.getElementById("message").innerText = "Invalid Credentials";
          }
      };
  </script>
  </html>
  ```

---

## **8. Configure Playwright Test Cases**

* Create a folder named `tests` and inside it, create a file `login.spec.js`:

  ```javascript
  const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

  test('Valid Login Test', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('http://localhost:5500/login.html');
      await page.fill('#username', 'techril');
      await page.fill('#password', 'password123');
      await page.click('button');
      await expect(page.locator('#message')).toHaveText('Login Successful');
  });

  test('Invalid Login Test', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('http://localhost:5500/login.html');
      await page.fill('#username', 'wrongUser');
      await page.fill('#password', 'wrongPass');
      await page.click('button');
      await expect(page.locator('#message')).toHaveText('Invalid Credentials');
  });
  ```

---

## **9. Run Playwright Tests**

* Start a local server for the HTML file:

  ```bash
  npx live-server --port=5500
  ```
  
  ![alt text](../images/img61.png)

  ![alt text](../images/img62.png)

* Run the Playwright tests:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```
* This will execute both the valid and invalid login tests.

---

## **10. Automate Test Generation Using GitHub Copilot**

* Go to the GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Alt+C).
* Set the mode to `GPT-4` with `Agent Mode`.
* Provide the following prompt:

  ```plaintext
  Create a UI test automation script using Playwright for my login page, 
  with scenarios for both valid and invalid login.
  ```

---

## **11. Debugging with Copilot**

* If any test fails, you can ask Copilot for suggestions:

  ```plaintext
  Why is my test failing?
  ```
* Copilot will provide debugging suggestions.
