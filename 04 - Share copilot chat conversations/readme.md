### **What Happens Next**

#### **Teammate View**

* When your teammate opens the link, they will:

  * See the **entire Copilot conversation**.
  * Have the option to **continue the chat** from that point.

#### **Private Forking**

* As soon as the teammate **asks their own question** in the shared conversation:

  * The chat becomes **private to them**.
  * Further messages will **not be visible** to the original sharer.

### **Important Notes on Access**

* If your chat references a **private repository**, the recipient must have access, or they'll get an **access denied** error.
* If the chat is **not tied to any repo**, it‚Äôs freely shareable.

### **Managing Shared Conversations**

* You can revisit Copilot Chat and manage your shared conversations:

  * **Copy the link again**
  * **Unshare** the conversation if needed
